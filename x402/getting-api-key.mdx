# Get Your API Key

API keys are required for **servers** that want to protect endpoints with x402 payments. Clients (users paying for APIs) don't need an API key.

<Note>
  API keys are **free** to create. You only need a wallet to sign in.
</Note>

## Step 1: Go to the Dashboard

Visit the facilitator dashboard: [facilitator.agentokratia.com](https://facilitator.agentokratia.com)

<Note>
  API keys are tied to your **receiving wallet** - the address where you get paid. One key lets you settle on any EVM network the facilitator supports. Sessions are created per-network.
</Note>

## Step 2: Connect Your Wallet

Click **"Connect Wallet"** and sign in using SIWE (Sign-In with Ethereum).

Supported wallets:
- MetaMask
- Coinbase Wallet
- WalletConnect
- Rainbow
- Any EIP-1193 compatible wallet

You'll be asked to sign a message like:

```
facilitator.agentokratia.com wants you to sign in with your Ethereum account:
0xYourAddress...

Sign in to x402 Facilitator

URI: https://facilitator.agentokratia.com
Version: 1
Chain ID: 8453
Nonce: abc123xyz
Issued At: 2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z
```

<Warning>
  This is a **signature**, not a transaction. It costs no gas and moves no funds.
</Warning>

## Step 3: Create an API Key

After signing in:

1. Navigate to **API Keys** section
2. Click **"Create New Key"**
3. Enter a name (e.g., "Production Server" or "Development")
4. Click **"Create"**

## Step 4: Copy and Save Your Key

Your API key will be displayed **once**:

```
x402_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

<Warning>
  **Save this immediately!** The key is shown only once and cannot be retrieved later. If you lose it, you'll need to create a new one.
</Warning>

Store your key securely:
- Use environment variables (never commit to git)
- Use a secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, Vault, etc.)
- For local development, use `.env` files (add to `.gitignore`)

## Step 5: Add to Your Server

```bash .env
FACILITATOR_URL=https://facilitator.agentokratia.com

# Your API key (works on all networks)
X402_API_KEY=x402_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Then in your code:

```typescript
const facilitator = new HTTPFacilitatorClient({
  url: process.env.FACILITATOR_URL!,
  createAuthHeaders: async () => ({
    verify: { Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.X402_API_KEY}` },
    settle: { Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.X402_API_KEY}` },
    supported: {},
  }),
});
```

## API Key Scope

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Receiving Wallet** | API keys are tied to your receiving wallet address (where you get paid) |
| **All Networks** | Same key works on any EVM-compatible network the facilitator supports |
| **Per Service** | Use one API key to integrate your service with the facilitator |
| **Sessions** | Sessions are created per-network (each session lives on one chain) |

<Note>
  One API key = one integration. You can settle payments on any supported network (Base Mainnet, Base Sepolia, etc.) using the same key. The network is specified per-request when settling.
</Note>

## Rate Limits

| Endpoint | Limit |
|----------|-------|
| `/api/verify` | 1000/min per key |
| `/api/settle` | 1000/min per key |
