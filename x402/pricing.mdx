# Pricing & Costs

Understanding who pays what in the x402 escrow system.

## Cost Summary

| Party | What They Pay |
|-------|---------------|
| **User (Payer)** | USDC deposit only (no gas needed) |
| **API Provider** | Nothing - fees sponsored |
| **Agentokratia** | Gas + platform fees (sponsored) |

<Tip>
**Zero cost to get started.** All fees are currently sponsored by Agentokratia.
</Tip>

## Facilitator Fee

<Info>
**Fees are currently sponsored by Agentokratia.** We cover all gas costs and charge no platform fee. This allows you to focus on building without worrying about costs.
</Info>

| Cost | Who Pays |
|------|----------|
| Platform fee | **Sponsored** (normally would be a % of transactions) |
| Gas costs | **Sponsored** (session creation, captures, voids) |

We'll keep you updated on any changes.

## User Costs

Users pay only their USDC deposit. No gas required.

### Example

```
User deposits: $10.00 USDC
User spends:   $3.50 on API calls
User reclaims: $6.50 (100% of unused funds)
```

The user's wallet never pays gas because x402 uses ERC-3009 signatures (gasless approvals).

## Minimum Amounts

| Type | Minimum |
|------|---------|
| Session deposit | $0.01 USDC |
| Per-request charge | $0.0001 USDC (1/100th of a cent) |

<Note>
  While technically you can charge fractions of a cent, consider user experience. Most APIs charge $0.001 - $0.10 per call.
</Note>

## API Provider Revenue

As an API provider, you receive:

```
Your Revenue = Sum of all charges to user sessions
```

### Revenue Flow

1. User creates session with $10 deposit
2. Your API charges $0.05 per request
3. User makes 50 requests = $2.50 charged
4. Facilitator captures $2.50 to your wallet
5. User reclaims remaining $7.50

### When Do I Get Paid?

The facilitator batches captures for gas efficiency:

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Pending > $1 | Batch capture (hourly cron) |
| Session expiry < 2h | Immediate capture |
| User reclaims | Capture pending, then void |

You'll typically see funds within 1-2 hours of charges accumulating.

## Gas Costs (Paid by Facilitator)

For transparency, here's what operations cost on Base:

| Operation | Approximate Gas | Approximate Cost |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| Session creation | ~150k gas | ~$0.01-0.05 |
| Batch capture | ~80k gas per session | ~$0.005-0.02 |
| Session void (reclaim) | ~100k gas | ~$0.01-0.03 |

<Note>
  These costs are covered by the facilitator, not you or your users.
</Note>

## Escrow vs Exact: Cost Comparison

| Scheme | Gas per Request | Best For |
|--------|-----------------|----------|
| **Exact** | ~65k gas ($0.005-0.02) | Single high-value calls |
| **Escrow** | 0 gas (off-chain) | High-frequency, low-value calls |

### Break-even Analysis

If each request costs the facilitator ~$0.01 in gas:

- **1 request:** Exact is fine
- **10+ requests:** Escrow saves money
- **100+ requests:** Escrow saves significant money

## Setting Your Prices

### Recommended Pricing

| API Type | Suggested Price |
|----------|-----------------|
| Simple query | $0.001 - $0.01 |
| AI inference (small) | $0.01 - $0.05 |
| AI inference (large) | $0.05 - $0.50 |
| Data export | $0.10 - $1.00 |
| Premium feature | $1.00+ |

### Price Format Examples

```typescript
// Human-readable (recommended)
price: '$0.01'      // 1 cent
price: '$0.001'     // 0.1 cents
price: '$1.50'      // $1.50

// Atomic units (6 decimals for USDC)
price: '10000'      // $0.01
price: '1000'       // $0.001
price: '1500000'    // $1.50
```

## Free Tier Strategy

Want to offer free requests before charging?

```typescript
app.use(paymentMiddleware({
  'GET /api/query': {
    accepts: {
      scheme: 'escrow',
      price: '$0.01',
      network: 'eip155:8453',
      payTo: process.env.PAYMENT_ADDRESS!,
    },
    // Add your own middleware to check free tier
  },
}, x402));

// Before the payment middleware
app.use('/api/query', (req, res, next) => {
  const user = getUser(req);
  if (user.freeRequestsRemaining > 0) {
    user.freeRequestsRemaining--;
    return yourHandler(req, res);
  }
  next(); // Proceed to payment
});
```

## Tax Considerations

<Warning>
  This is not tax advice. Consult a tax professional.
</Warning>

Revenue from x402 payments is likely taxable income. Keep records of:
- Total USDC received
- USD value at time of receipt
- Associated costs

The facilitator provides transaction history in the dashboard.
