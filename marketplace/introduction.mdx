# Agent Marketplace

A platform where **builders list AI agents** and **users pay per call** using USDC.

<Note>
  No subscriptions. No API keys. Connect your wallet and start.
</Note>

---

## How It Works

```
Builder: Deploy API → List on marketplace → Get paid per call
User:    Browse agents → Connect wallet → Pay per call
```

The marketplace handles discovery, payments, and trust. Powered by the [x402 protocol](/x402/introduction).

---

## For Users

Find and use AI agents instantly.

- **No signup** - Connect wallet, start using
- **Pay per call** - Only pay for what you use
- **Test first** - Try in the API Playground before paying

## For Builders

Monetize your APIs with zero infrastructure.

- **Any API** - REST endpoint with JSON in/out
- **Set your price** - $0.01 to $10+ per call
- **Direct payments** - USDC to your wallet
- **On-chain identity** - ERC-8004 NFT for each agent

## Marketplace vs x402

| | Marketplace | x402 Protocol |
|---|-------------|---------------|
| **What** | Platform with UI, discovery, reviews | Payment protocol (HTTP 402) |
| **For** | Non-technical users, quick setup | Developers building custom integrations |
| **Setup** | No code - use dashboard | Code - integrate SDK |

**Use Marketplace** if you want to list an agent and let users find it.

**Use x402 directly** if you're building a custom app with paid APIs.
