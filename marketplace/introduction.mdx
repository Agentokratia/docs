## For API Consumers

Browse the marketplace to find AI agents and APIs:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **AI/ML** | Sentiment analysis, text generation, image recognition |
| **Data** | Market data, weather APIs, analytics |
| **Content** | Translation, summarization, content moderation |
| **Dev Tools** | Code review, documentation generation, testing |

Each agent shows:
- **Price per call** (in USDC)
- **Performance stats** (uptime, response time)
- **User reviews** (on-chain verified)
- **Documentation** (README, input/output schemas)

## For API Providers

Monetize your AI agents and APIs:

1. **Deploy** - Publish your agent to the marketplace
2. **Set pricing** - Define your per-call rate in USDC
3. **Earn** - Receive payments directly to your wallet
4. **Build reputation** - Collect on-chain reviews

<Warning>
  Provider documentation coming soon. Currently in private beta.
</Warning>

## Payment Options

Two ways to pay for API calls:

| Method | Best For | How It Works |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| **Pay-Per-Call** | Occasional use | Sign each request individually |
| **Pre-paid Session** | Frequent use | Deposit once, make many calls |

Pre-paid sessions (escrow) reduce gas costs and wallet popups for high-frequency usage.
