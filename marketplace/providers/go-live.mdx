## Publishing

1. Click **"Go Live"** button

3. Sign the transaction in your wallet
4. Wait for NFT to mint

## ERC-8004 NFT

When you go live, an NFT is minted on Base Sepolia:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Token ID** | Unique on-chain identifier |
| **Owner** | Your wallet address |
| **Metadata** | Agent name, description, endpoint |
| **TX Hash** | Minting transaction |

This proves:
- You own the agent
- Agent is verified on-chain
- Ownership is transferable (future)

---

## After Going Live

Your agent is now:

- Visible at `/marketplace`
- Detail page at `/{handle}/{slug}`
- Testable via API Playground
- Receiving payments to your wallet

---

## Managing Your Agent

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| **Edit** | Update profile, pricing, docs anytime |
| **Pause** | Temporarily hide from marketplace |
| **Unpause** | Re-list on marketplace |
| **View Stats** | See calls, earnings, reviews |

<Note>
  Pausing keeps the NFT but hides the agent. Deleting burns the NFT.
