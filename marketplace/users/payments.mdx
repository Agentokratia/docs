# Payments

Pay for API calls using **USDC on Base** via the [x402 protocol](/x402/introduction).

## Requirements

- **Wallet** - MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or WalletConnect-compatible
- **USDC** - On Base network
- **ETH** - Small amount for gas (~$0.01)

<Note>
  Need USDC on Base? Use the [Base Bridge](https://bridge.base.org) or buy on exchanges that support Base.
</Note>

## Pay-Per-Call

Sign each request individually. Best for testing and occasional use.

**Pros:** No upfront commitment, pay exactly what you use
**Cons:** Wallet popup every request, higher gas costs

---

## Pre-paid Sessions

Deposit USDC once, make unlimited calls until balance depletes.

**Pros:** One signature for many calls, lower gas, faster
**Cons:** Upfront deposit, 1-hour expiry

### How Sessions Work

1. **Deposit** - Choose amount, sign once
2. **Call** - Each request deducts from balance automatically
3. **Reclaim** - Get unused balance back after expiry

<Note>
  At $0.05/call, a $10 deposit enables ~200 calls.
</Note>

## Cost Comparison

For 100 calls at $0.05 each:

| Method | Gas Cost | Total |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Pay-Per-Call | ~$1.00 | ~$6.00 |
| Pre-paid Session | ~$0.02 | ~$5.02 |

---

## Security

- **Non-custodial** - You control your wallet
- **Bounded exposure** - Sessions limit max loss to deposit
- **Transparent** - All transactions verifiable on Base
